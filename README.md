## Notes

The most challenging problem while building the app is cleaning up the fetched json data and finding a way to display it so that the web app can print the desired result on the screen (for example: making the price breakdown chart
to display on the detail page as HTML form was painful). Also, it was pretty frustrating when I tried to keep the sidebar stay for every renders in which I used a different strategy from what I learned from CodePath
